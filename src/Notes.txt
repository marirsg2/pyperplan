3) Do not normalize boolean variables

REMOVE features that do not change, per domain.

5 min timeout - like in sylvie paper

Sylvie compares with pyperplan's
mcut', 'gpfeatures', 'landmark', 'blind', 'hadd', 'hff', 'hmax', 'hsa')
SEE their paper graph and pick those features

===========================================================
0) Round up (ceiling) of the heuristic - DONE

0.5) get lama-first - maybe get initial heuristic from FDownward - DONE
    using results from FastDownward

1) 20-30 fixed set of problems - DONE
     i) 2 rooms, large number of balls
     ii) goals with all balls in one room
     iii) 13 balls
     DEFINITELY USE THE GENERATOR, the template code can be reused and will save a lot of time later.
     iv) use generator / see if IPC problems are compatible


4) Blocksworld (training data generator)\


5) Daniel - lisp socket communication.
    send pddl as string. receive csv data
